# Numpy_Operations

#### let's build some basic functions with Numpy

1 - Sigmoid function implemented with math library and numpy library.

<br>

2 - Derivative of sigmoid function. Derivative are used in back propagation which is the technique used for optimization

<br>

3 - Reshaping Function

<br>

4 - Row normalization function
